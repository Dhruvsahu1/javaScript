CLOSURES :-> A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with refrences to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.
In javaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, and they are not dependent on the scope in which they are created. This means that the function can access the variables and parameters of the outer function even after the outer function has returned.


A closure is a function that has access to the outer function's variables even after the outer function has returned. It is a way to create private variables and functions inside a function.



LEXICAL SCOPING ;-> Lexical scoping refers to the way in which a programming language resolves variable names. In lexical scoping, the scope of a variable is determined by the location of the variable in the source code. In other words, the scope of a variable is determined by the position of the variable in the code, not by the function in which it is defined.
