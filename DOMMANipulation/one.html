<!--  DOM Stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface for HTML, XML, and SVG documents. It defines the way in which the web page content is presented to the user, and how it can be modified. -->

<!-- The working of Dom 
     first go to the browser and select one page 
     now go to console and type [Console.log(widow.document)|| Console.log(document)]
     by this you can see what type of elements are present in the page
     You also can access many properties of the document like document.body, document.head, document.title, etc.
     If you log document .links you can get HTMLCollection of all the links present in the page.
     but make a not this is not an array it is an HTMLCollection


     <!-- Now do one thing select any heading with its class name from that page 
      use 
     [ document.getElementsByClassName('class name')]
      and you can get all the elements with that class name.
      then you can use this element to manipulate it.
      like
      [ document.getElementsByClassName('class name').innerHTML = 'new text']
      to change the innerHTML of that element.

      THis is the basic of DOM Manipulation in JavaScript.
